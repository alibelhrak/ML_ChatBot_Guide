# ML_ChatBot_Guide

An interactive Streamlit chatbot that answers questions about Machine Learning by leveraging a PDF guide, semantic search with FAISS embeddings, and Groq's large language model.

---

## Description

This project creates a question-answering chatbot based on a Machine Learning beginner's PDF guide. It processes the PDF into searchable text chunks, generates embeddings using HuggingFace models, and performs similarity search with FAISS. Answers are generated by a Groq LLM, which reads the retrieved context to respond accurately without hallucination.

## Features

- PDF document loading and text splitting
- Semantic search using FAISS and sentence-transformers embeddings
- Integration with Groq's llama3-70b LLM for context-aware answer generation
- Streamlit web interface for easy question answering
- Prevents hallucination by instructing the model to say "I don't know" if unsure
